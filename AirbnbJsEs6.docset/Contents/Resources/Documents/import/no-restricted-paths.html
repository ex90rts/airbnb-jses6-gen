<h1 id="no-restricted-paths-restrict-which-files-can-be-imported-in-a-given-folder">no-restricted-paths - Restrict which files can be imported in a given folder</h1>
<p>Some projects contain files which are not always meant to be executed in the same environment.
For example consider a web application that contains specific code for the server and some specific code for the browser/client. In this case you don’t want to import server-only files in your client code.</p>
<p>In order to prevent such scenarios this rule allows you to define restricted zones where you can forbid files from imported if they match a specific path.</p>
<h2 id="rule-details">Rule Details</h2>
<p>This rule has one option. The option is an object containing the definition of all restricted <code>zones</code> and the optional <code>basePath</code> which is used to resolve relative paths within.
The default value for <code>basePath</code> is the current working directory.
Each zone consists of the <code>target</code> path and a <code>from</code> path. The <code>target</code> is the path where the restricted imports should be applied. The <code>from</code> path defines the folder that is not allowed to be used in an import.</p>
<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>
<p>Given the following folder structure:</p>
<pre><code>my-project
├── client
│   └── foo.js
│   └── baz.js
└── server
    └── bar.js
</code></pre><p>and the current file being linted is <code>my-project/client/foo.js</code>.</p>
<p>The following patterns are considered problems when configuration set to <code>{ &quot;zones&quot;: [ { &quot;target&quot;: &quot;./client&quot;, &quot;from&quot;: &quot;./server&quot; } ] }</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">import bar from &#39;../server/bar&#39;;
</code></pre>
<p>The following patterns are not considered problems when configuration set to <code>{ &quot;zones&quot;: [ { &quot;target&quot;: &quot;./client&quot;, &quot;from&quot;: &quot;./server&quot; } ] }</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">import baz from &#39;../client/baz&#39;;
</code></pre>
