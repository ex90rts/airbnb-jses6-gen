<h1 id="disallow-synchronous-methods-no-sync-">Disallow Synchronous Methods (no-sync)</h1>
<p>In Node.js, most I/O is done through asynchronous methods. However, there are often synchronous versions of the asynchronous methods. For example, <code>fs.exists()</code> and <code>fs.existsSync()</code>. In some contexts, using synchronous operations is okay (if, as with ESLint, you are writing a command line utility). However, in other contexts the use of synchronous operations is considered a bad practice that should be avoided. For example, if you are running a high-travel web server on Node.js, you should consider carefully if you want to allow any synchronous operations that could lock up the server.</p>
<h2 id="rule-details">Rule Details</h2>
<p>This rule is aimed at preventing synchronous methods from being called in Node.js. It looks specifically for the method suffix &quot;<code>Sync</code>&quot; (as is the convention with Node.js operations).</p>
<p class="incorrect icon">Examples of <strong>incorrect</strong> code for this rule:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">/*eslint no-sync: &quot;error&quot;*/

fs.existsSync(somePath);

var contents = fs.readFileSync(somePath).toString();
</code></pre>
<p class="correct icon">Examples of <strong>correct</strong> code for this rule:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">/*eslint no-sync: &quot;error&quot;*/

obj.sync();

async(function() {
    // ...
});
